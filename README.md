# UTTC hackathon back

I participated in a hackathon and this is the code server side. <br />
I created a simple knowledgebase; a website to store websites, books, videos so you could search for it afterwards.
I used 
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Cloud Storage
- Vercel
- Google Cloud Platform
- golang
- typescript (react)

I deployed it using goolgle cloud platform and client side using vercel.
Below is the link to access the website.<br />

Unfortunately, due to the cost of GCP (google cloud platform), I am going to stop the deployment soon. <br />
